# Project Scope
This project aims at the development of good machine learning practice guidelines to educate the developers and manufacturers of healthcare AI solutions on how to conduct a comprehensive requirements analysis and conformity assessment procedures for continual product improvement in an iterative and adaptive manner in conformance with the applicable standards and regulations.

## Aims and Objectives
* To help manufacturers familiarize with international laws and regulations that applies to AI/ML-based medical devices and to bring them to market quickly and effectively.

* To help internal and external auditors test the legal conformity of AI/ML-based medical devices and the associated life-cycle process

## Planned Outputs

* Regulatory requirements guidelines document that covers the technical , functional, safety & efficacy aspects of the entire product life cycle of AI/ML based medical devices. The scope AI/ML based medical devices include the following:

  a) Medical device:
    –	with enforcement of regulations
    –	without enforcement of regulations.

  b) Product scope
    –	software is the product ->standalone software –Software-as-medical device (SaMD)
    –	software is embedded in the product- Software-in-medical device (SiMD)
