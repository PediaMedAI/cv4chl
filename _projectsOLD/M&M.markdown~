# Scope
Since 2020, the Measures & Metrics workstream has researched regulatory aspects inside of Machine Learning for Health. We study a collection of SOTA ML quality assurance methods like bias, generalizations, robustness, uncertainty, and so forth about use cases and regulatory topics. Our expectation is finish the project until the end of 2022.

Today, our multidisciplinary team has students and professionals from different companies, laboratories, universities worldwide focusing on creating regulatory documents and providing better solutions to society.

We already developed a paper about Machine Learning for Health Audit in this workstream (see in publications). Our objective is to move to easy to maintain and use web resources.

#### Aims
* Develop better regulations by publications, international standards about measures, and metrics inside Machine Learning for Health.

* Regulatory documents about measures & metrics inside of Machine Learning.

* Paper about bias, robustness, uncertainties and other aspects of M&M in ML4H.

#### Outputs
