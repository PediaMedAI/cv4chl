We use OpenReview to host papers and manage the submissions and reviewing process. All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile, properly attributed with current and past institutional affiliation. The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.

Abstracts and papers can be submitted through the OpenReview platform: [OpenReview Submission Site](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Workshop/AI4CHL).

We invite submissions of papers on all topics related to **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Children**, not limited to AI for Pediatrics, AI for Psycology, and AI for Education. All papers will be reviewed in a double-blind process and accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

1. *New Methods on AI for Children (Deep Learning, Representation Learning, Embodied AI, Large Language Models, Reinforcement learning, Foundation Models, etc.)*

2. *New AI Datasets and Benchmarks about Children (Pediatrics, Child Psychology, Child Development, Education, etc.)*

3. *New Viewpoint, Prospective, Case Study, Position Paper, Survey Paper about risk and opportunity for Pediatrics, Child Development, Child Education in the AI Ara*

There are two track for paper submissions.

**Main Track** Submissions should be between 6--10 pages in length for the main text, formatted according to the [ICLR 2025 style file](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2025.zip). There is no limit on the length of the references and appendix. All accepted papers will be **non-archival**, and each submission will undergo a rigorous review by at least 3 reviewers in a double-blind manner. Conflicts of interest will be managed using the OpenReview platform's mechanisms.


**Tiny Paper Track** This year, ICLR is discontinuing the separate “Tiny Papers” track, and is instead requiring each workshop to accept short (2-4 pages in ICLR format) paper submissions, with an eye towards inclusion; see [CallForTinyPapers](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers) for more details. We recommend the authors submit ongoing projects, case study, viewpoint, and prospective to the “Tiny Papers” track. Authors of these papers will be earmarked for potential funding from ICLR, but need to submit a separate application for Financial Assistance that evaluates their eligibility. This application for Financial Assistance to attend ICLR 2025 will become available on [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025) at the beginning of February and close on March 2nd.
