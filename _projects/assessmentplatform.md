# Scope
The [ITU/ WHO AI4H Assessment Platform](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/opencode.aspx) is a software platform that supports the end-to-end process for assessing health AI algorithms at a global level for the benefit of health AI companies and regulators, who need to proof that a health AI product is fit for purpose in compliance with the medical, technological, and regulatory requirements.

The [ITU/ WHO AI4H Assesment Platform](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/opencode.aspx) is implemented as a open code software project and aims to produce the digital building blocks that comprises of the following 6 software packages - Data Acquisition Package (DAP), Data Storage Package (DP), an Annotation Package (AP), a Prediction Package (PP), an Evaluation Package (EP) and a Reporting Package (RP).  The AI4H Assessment Platform is released under a modified BSD license and follows a standard development process.

Aiaudit.org is currently coordinating the implementation of two software packages of the Assesment Platform namely 1)  Evaluation Package and 2) Reporting Package.

#### Evaluation Package
The Evaluation Package(EP) provides meaningful metrics that are agreed to be state-of-the-art and have the strongest expressibility to compare the performance of different AI models.

##### Aims
1. To develop testing measures and metrics for different quality dimensions, including interpretation, bias, uncertainty, and robustness.

2. To develop survey questionnaires to elicit information about the data preperation and ML model development processes with an aim for qualitative assessment of the applicability and safety of its solution outcomes

#### Reporting Package
The Reporting Package (RP) deals with the preparation and presentation of ML model evaluation results generated by the Evaluation Package (EP)

##### Aims
To provide a customizable reporting interface for supporting ease of comparison,  classification and reproducibility of different AI4H model evaluation results
